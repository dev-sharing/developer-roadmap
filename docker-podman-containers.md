### Code Architecture
Frameworks and tooling
Within Podman Desktop, we use the following frameworks and tools to build the desktop application:

- Electron: In order to deploy cross-platform to multiple operating systems.
- Svelte: The reactive UI/UX framework for building the interface.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for the UI/UX framework.
- Vite: Dev tooling for rapid development, debugging and deployment.

**NOTE: We also use TypeScript instead of JavaScript for strongly typed programming language development.**

### Testing
Within Podman Desktop, we use the following for testing:

- Vitest: Unit tests - Written as spec.ts files.
- Testing Library: Component tests - Utilities and best practices for writing component tests.
- Playwright: Integration and E2E tests.

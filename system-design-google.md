"I worked at Google,  everything was Java 8. I worked at Amazon... hell i worked on some stuff that was still Java 7. Both of those teams worked on core services.
Java is proof that the syntactic sugar that devs get hyped about means very little, the value of a language is in its stability over the long haul"
